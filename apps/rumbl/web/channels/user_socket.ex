  ## Channels
  # Transports route events into this UserSocket where they are dispatched into
  # your channels based on topic patterns declared here using the channel macro.
  # The videos:* convention will categorize topics with a resource name,
  # followed by a resource ID. So, almost like a route?
  channel "videos:*", Rumbl.VideoChannel

  ## Transports
  transport :websocket, Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket
  # transport :longpoll, Phoenix.Transports.LongPoll

  # Socket params are passed from the client and can
  # be used to verify and authenticate a user. After
  # verification, you can put default assigns into
  # the socket that will be set for all channels, ie
  #
  #     {:ok, assign(socket, :user_id, verified_user_id)}
  #
  # To deny connection, return `:error`.
  #
  # See `Phoenix.Token` documentation for examples in
  # performing token verification on connect.

  # Set max_age, which will be used to determine max age of the token, to
  # two weeks.
  @max_age 2 * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60

        :error
    end
  end

  # Socket id's are topics that allow you to identify all sockets for a given user:
  #
  #     def id(socket), do: "users_socket:#{socket.assigns.user_id}"
  #
  # Would allow you to broadcast a "disconnect" event and terminate
  # all active sockets and channels for a given user:
  #
  #     Rumbl.Endpoint.broadcast("users_socket:#{user.id}", "disconnect", %{})
  #
  # Returning `nil` makes this socket anonymous.
  def id(socket), do: "users_socket:#{socket.assigns.user_id}"
